3 Command names are capitalized, parameter values separated by space

4 TODO - REMOVE_PHONE command must throw an exception if there is no such phone in the PhoneBook. The exception must be handled and reason must be printed out (see PhoneBookFormatter).

5 DONE - If in the result of REMOVE_PHONE command execution the set of phones will be empty the record must be completely removed from the PhoneBook.

7 The application should work the same way no matter what configuration source is provided.
